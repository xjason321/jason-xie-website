                Hey there! c:
                <br /><br />
                I am a junior-level student at the University of Wisconsin- Madison 
                majoring in computer science. I’ve gained a strong foundation in 
                object-oriented programming and data structures and algorithms. 
                <br /><br />
                In addition, I’ve gained practical skills through projects such as 
                Spinor AI and hackathon competitions such as the Congressional App Challenge. 
                Through these experiences, I have learned to efficiently manage Git repositories
                and facilitate version control across a team, as well as engage in both collaborative 
                and independent programming.
                <br /><br />
                In my current role at Spinor AI, I build website content using my knowledge in React, 
                maintain frontend to backend communication through RESTful APIs, and create the structure 
                for the database that securely stores user information. These experiences have taught me 
                how to learn new frameworks and languages quickly, and, more significantly, how I can apply 
                those skills to drive success.
                <br /><br />
