## Step 6: Optimize for SEO

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) helps your website rank higher in search engine results. Use relevant keywords, create quality content, and ensure your website is mobile-friendly to improve your SEO.

## Step 7: Launch Your Website

Once you’ve designed your website and created content, it’s time to launch. Double-check everything to ensure it works correctly, then publish your website for the world to see.

## Step 8: Promote Your Website
