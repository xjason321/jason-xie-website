# Experiment Note: Raycasting

## Date
October 5, 2023

## Objective
To explore the implementation and performance of raycasting in a 3D environment.

## Setup
- **Environment:** Unity 2021.3.0f1
- **Language:** C#
- **Tools:** Visual Studio, Unity Editor

## Procedure
1. **Initialize the Scene:**
    - Create a new 3D project in Unity.
    - Add a plane to act as the ground.
    - Place several 3D objects (cubes, spheres) at various positions.

2. **Implement Raycasting:**
    - Attach a script to the main camera to handle raycasting.
    - In the script, use `Physics.Raycast` to detect objects in the scene.
    - Log the name of the object hit by the ray.

3. **Testing:**
    - Run the scene and move the camera around.
    - Observe the console for raycast hit logs.

## Observations
- Raycasting successfully detected objects in the scene.
- Performance was smooth with no noticeable lag.
- The accuracy of raycasting was consistent across different object shapes and sizes.

## Conclusion
Raycasting in Unity is an effective method for detecting objects in a 3D environment. It provides accurate and real-time feedback, making it suitable for various applications such as collision detection and line-of-sight calculations.

## Next Steps
- Experiment with different raycasting techniques (e.g., sphere casting).
- Optimize raycasting for larger scenes.
- Integrate raycasting with game mechanics (e.g., shooting, object interaction).
